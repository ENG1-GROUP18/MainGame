Updated with code from a menu test. Its messy but will refactor soon.
This will be the project we add to from now on.


Follows program structure shown in [this tutorial](https://www.gamedevelopment.blog/full-libgdx-game-tutorial-flgt-home/). If you need help understanding the structure of the project, this is a good place to start.

I will alter it slightly but the meeting on friday will determine how the project moves forward (so wont add much more until then).

Old project was moved to [here](https://github.com/ENG1-GROUP18/MainGame-OLD).
